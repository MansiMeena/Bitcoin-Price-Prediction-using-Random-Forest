# Bitcoin-Price-Prediction-using-Random-Forest
Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies that have garnered significant investor attention in the financial markets. The aim of this project is to predict the daily price, particularly the daily closing price of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. This plays a vital role in making trading decisions. There exist various factors which affect the price of Bitcoin, thereby making price prediction a complex and technically challenging task. To perform prediction, random forest model was trained on the historical time series which is the past prices of Bitcoin over several years. Features such as the opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, volume of Bitcoin, volume of currencies, and weighted price were taken into consideration so as to predict the closing price of
the next day. Random forest model designed and implemented on both of pyspark and scikit learn frameworks to build predictive analysis and evaluated them by computing various measures such as the RMSE (root mean square error) and r (Pearsonâ€™s correlation coefficient) on test data. Pyspark framework was used to make parallelize the creating trees when training the random forest to handle bigdata.
